# Ridi stability improvements and 5 free Ridi routes

Hey riders! Summer's here and I've been grinding on some major updates for Ridi.

_What's new:_

- Major performance improvements and bug fixes (route generation is way faster now)
- Fixed the crashes some of you reported
- Every registered user now gets 5 free unique route downloads

Started this project because I was tired of the same boring routes and spending
hours on Google Maps trying to piece together something interesting. I
test every route myself to make sure they're actually fun to ride, not just
algorithmically sound.

Still hunting down some bugs and have exciting features coming soon. Summer
won't last forever, so grab those free downloads and discover some new roads!

Ride safe and hit me up if you find any amazing routes through the app.
